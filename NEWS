Changes in version 0.7.1:
  o Fixed a bug for Solaris

Changes in version 0.7:
  o Major changes
    o Major restructuring of underlying core code. Most vital functions have been translated to C++, leading to a large speedup!
    o Added C++ based optimizers cpp_L-BFGS-B, cpp_CG, cpp_SANN, and cpp_Nelder. These are faster but slightly less stable than nlminb (now the default optimizer).
    o Verbose now defaults to FALSE everywhere. This can be set with the setverbose function for a model
    o Added meta-analysis model for varcov family (meta_varcov)
    o The ml_tsdlvm1 function now allows for multi-kevek tsdlvm1 models (dlvm1 models) to be specified using syntax familiar to those using mlVAR and graphicalVAR
  o Minor changes
    o Numerous small bugfixes and improvements (e.g., better starting values)
    o Added function 'fullFIML' to use true FIML computing the likelihood per row
    o Changed 'WLS.V' to 'WLS.W'
    o Several warning messages have been updated
  

Changes in version 0.6:
  o The 'dlvm1' model family now also returns the implied latent variance-covarriance matrix as 'sigma_eta_within'
      o The latent lag-1 matrix is also returned as 'sigma_eta_within_lag1'
  o The dlvm1 model family now no longer requires a 'lambda' matrix to be specified (will default to a panelvar model)
  o Most model families now support the 'standardized' argument, which can be set to 'z' for z-scores (helps convergence) or 'quantile' for a semiparametric transformation
  o Added the ml_lvm family for two-level random intercept latent variable models
  o Added the simplestructure function to easily make a lambda matrix
  o addalpha in modelsearch now works as expected
  o addalpha and prunealpha now default to 0.01 in 'modelsearch'
  o recursive now defaults to FALSE in 'prune'

Changes in version 0.5.1:
  o Fixed a bug with responses being missing when summary statistics are used in Ising()
  o Fixed a bug with covtype sometimes being set to UB when corinput = TRUE
  o Added DOI to description field

Changes in version 0.5.0:
  o The Ising model is now supported (only ML estimation) through the Ising() model function
  o Added the covtype option to several models, controlling if maximum likelihood or unbiased estimates are used for the input covariances
  o Added the function 'covML' for maximum likelihood covariance estimates

Changes in version 0.4.1:
  o Small fix for CRAN checks

Changes in version 0.4:
  o type = "cor" is now supported in varcov, with rho representing the correlations and SD the diagonal standard deviations matrix.
      o The 'corr' function is now implemented as shorthand for varcov(..., type = "cor")
  o The scale of the Fisher information matrix has been adjusted to portray unit information to be similar to Lavaan
  o The getVCOV function has been added to obtain the estimated asymptotic var-cov matrix of the parameters.
  o The meanstructure can now be ignored using meanstructure = TRUE in the following model families:
    - varcov
  o A correlation matrix can now be used as input (detected or set with corinput = TRUE) for the following families:
    - varcov (type = "ggm" and type = "cor")
  o The WLS estimator will now not investigate means when meanstructure is ignored, and variances when a correlaton matrix is used as input.
    - The WLS weights matrix must be of the appropriate dimensions!
    - The WLS.V matrix will no longer be adjusted for missing means.
    - Added 'startEPC' argument to stepup and freepar
  o Added the 'modelsearch' function for extensive stepwise model search
  o Fixed several bugs and improved starting values in several models

Changes in version 0.3.3:
  o prune() now removes diagonal values of temporal effects
  o psychonetrics now requires R 3.6
  o Some C++ fixes for Solaris
  
Changes in version 0.3.2:
	o The parameters function now invisibly returns the parameter estimate data frame
	o The MIs function now invisibly returns a data frame with MI estimates
	o fit now invisibly returns a data frame with fit measure estimates


Changes in version 0.3.1:
	o Several help-files are now updated with executable examples

Version 0.3.0: First version to be submitted to CRAN
