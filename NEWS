Changes in Version 0.14.23
  o Strip debug symbols from compiled shared library via linker flags in Makevars,
    reducing installed libs/ size on CRAN macOS builds (from ~29MB to ~2MB).
  o Added C++ pipeline for meta_lvm (implied, prepare, derivatives), providing
    ~2.8x speedup over the R-only implementation.
  o Fixed meta_lvm.Rd documentation to match actual function signature.

Changes in Version 0.14.22
  o meta_lvm() now accepts covariance matrices (not just correlations). The data vector
    includes diagonal elements (variances) alongside off-diagonal covariances, with free
    sigma_epsilon diagonal. V matrix computation, implied model, and derivatives updated
    to handle the full vech (with diagonal).
  o Fixed checkJacobian() and checkFisher() to respect the model's @cpp slot: models
    with cpp=FALSE (e.g., meta_lvm) now correctly use R-only fit/gradient/Fisher functions
    instead of always defaulting to C++ versions.
  o Fixed R CMD check --as-cran issues:
    o panelvar()/panelgvar() now handle missing data argument correctly
    o dlvm1() guards against missing data in auto-detect and samplestats calls
    o penalty_lambda documentation updated to match code default (NA, not 0)
    o Removed stray browser() calls from var1 implied and identify functions
    o Fixed non-ASCII character in NA2020.Rd reference
  o Removed continuous-data corinput from lvm(): correlations passed as covs are now
    treated as covariances with free diagonal. Ordinal corinput retained internally.

Changes in Version 0.14.20
  o Added meta_lvm() function for single-stage meta-analytic latent variable modeling.
    Combines a latent variable model (CFA/SEM) for the mean structure of pooled
    covariance/correlation matrices with a random-effects model for between-study
    heterogeneity. Extends the MAGNA framework to latent variable models. Supports all
    standard parameterizations for latent (cov/chol/prec/ggm), residual (cov/chol/prec/ggm),
    and random effects (chol/cov/prec/ggm/cor) structures.

Changes in Version 0.14.18
  o Standard errors now auto-fallback to approximate SEs when the Fisher information matrix
    cannot be inverted (e.g., due to zero cells in crosstables in multi-group Ising models).
    Previously this returned NA standard errors; now approximate SEs are computed automatically
    with an informative warning

Changes in Version 0.14.17
  o Fixed the 'equal' argument in multi-group lvm() models:
    o The equal= argument (e.g., equal="lambda") now correctly constrains parameters across groups
    o Previously, the equality flag was passed as a positional argument to fixMatrix, causing it to
      be silently ignored
    o Additionally fixed corrupted starting values when equal= is used: the lambda structure matrix
      contains integer codes (>1) for equality constraints, but these were used as multipliers for
      FA-derived starting values, producing extreme values that prevented convergence
    o Both loadings and variance identification now work correctly with equal=
    o Results from equal= now match those from the groupequal() workflow
  o Added OLS-based starting values for the beta (structural) matrix in lvm()/sem():
    o For each endogenous latent, OLS regression on FA-implied latent covariance provides initial
      beta coefficients
    o Disturbance covariance (sigma_zeta) is adjusted via (I-B)*Cov(eta)*(I-B)' instead of using
      the raw FA factor correlations
    o Guard rails for near-singular covariance, ill-conditioned predictor blocks, extreme
      coefficients, and near-singular (I-B)
    o Falls back to previous zero-initialization on any numerical issue
    o New 'start' argument: "default" for OLS-based, "simple" for zero-initialization
  o Added loop_psychonetrics() convenience function for parallel bootstrapping and simulations:
    o Replaces boilerplate of makeCluster / clusterExport / parLapply / stopCluster
    o Variables referenced in the expression are automatically detected and exported to workers
    o Uses pbapply progress bars and safe cluster cleanup via on.exit
    o Works with aggregate_bootstraps() and CIplot() for bootstrap analysis
  o Added the NA2020 dataset: 8 self-report items (n=501) from Isvoranu (2020) for GGM examples

Changes in Version 0.14.16
  o Added automatic lambda selection for PML/PFIML estimation via EBIC-based grid search:
    o New function find_penalized_lambda() searches over a log-spaced grid of 100 lambda values
    o Lambda now defaults to NA in all model constructors, signaling automatic selection
    o runmodel() automatically triggers the grid search when NA lambdas are detected
    o Lambda_max computed analytically from KKT conditions at the null-penalized model
    o Warm starts across the lambda path for efficient computation
    o Supports criterion selection: "bic", "ebic.25", "ebic.5" (default), "ebic.75", "ebic1"
    o Users can still specify a fixed lambda (e.g., penalty_lambda = 0.1) for manual control
  o Added beta_min thresholding for penalized estimates:
    o Near-zero estimates below beta_min are set to exactly zero after convergence
    o Default threshold: sqrt(log(p)/n) where p = number of penalized parameters
    o Applied both during EBIC evaluation (for degree-of-freedom counting) and on the final model
    o Reduces numerical noise from ISTA optimizer, improving specificity
    o Exposed as user argument in runmodel() and find_penalized_lambda()
  o EBIC for penalized model selection uses unpenalized log-likelihood at penalized estimates
    (Convention A), with npar = unpenalized free params + nonzero penalized params after threshold
  o Print and write methods now display lambda search results (selected lambda, criterion value,
    beta_min) and show "auto (not yet selected)" for models with NA lambda before estimation
  o NA-safe comparisons throughout the codebase for penalty_lambda column (print, write, refit,
    penalize, unpenalize, C++ workspace builder)

Changes in Version 0.14.15
  o Added PFIML (Penalized Full Information Maximum Likelihood) estimator:
    o Combines FIML with L1/L2 penalty for penalized estimation with missing data
    o Available for all Gaussian models (varcov, lvm, var1, dlvm1, tsdlvm1)
    o Uses proximal gradient optimizer (same as PML)
    o refit() switches PFIML back to FIML for post-selection inference
  o Changed default missing data handling to missing = "auto" for all Gaussian models:
    o ML automatically switches to FIML when missing data is detected
    o PML automatically switches to PFIML when missing data is detected
    o LS estimators (ULS, WLS, DWLS) default to listwise deletion
    o Users can still override with explicit missing = "listwise" or missing = "pairwise"
    o No change for Ising models (missing = "listwise" default remains)
  o Penalty setup in model constructors now supports PFIML:
    o estimator = "PML" and estimator = "PFIML" both trigger penalty initialization
    o Baseline/saturated models use the appropriate unpenalized estimator (ML or FIML)
  o Added experimental feature warnings for features introduced in the 0.14.x branch:
    o PML, PFIML, LBFGS++ optimizer, ordinal data in lvm()/varcov(), WLSMV scaled test statistic
    o Warnings appear once per session and only while version < 0.15
    o Users are directed to report unexpected behavior to GitHub issues

Changes in Version 0.14.14
  o Unified dlvm1() to accept both wide-format and long-format data:
    o New 'datatype' argument with options "auto" (default), "wide", and "long"
    o Auto-detects format from 'vars': matrix = wide, character vector = long
    o New 'idvar' and 'beepvar' arguments for long-format data
    o Long-to-wide conversion handled internally (previously required ml_tsdlvm1)
  o Added 'standardize' argument to dlvm1() with options:
    o "none" (default): no standardization
    o "z": global z-scores per variable across all waves (does not impose stationarity)
    o "quantile": quantile normalization across all waves
    o "z_per_wave": independent z-scores per wave column (imposes stationarity)
  o Added panellvgvar() as the canonical wrapper for panel latent variable GVAR models
  o Deprecated functions (still work but emit warnings):
    o ml_tsdlvm1() - use dlvm1() with long-format data instead
    o ml_gvar() - use dlvm1() with within_latent="ggm", between_latent="ggm"
    o ml_var() - use dlvm1() with desired within_latent and between_latent
    o ml_ts_lvgvar() - use panellvgvar() instead
    o panel_lvgvar() - use panellvgvar() instead

Changes in Version 0.14.13
  o Added write_psychonetrics() function for exporting comprehensive model output to a text file:
    o Produces Mplus/LISREL-style output with logo, sample info, model specification, parameter
      estimates, fit measures, model matrices, modification indices, and logbook
    o Intended for sharing as supplementary materials to papers
    o Supports uncomputed models: shows starting values with clear warnings, omitting SEs, p-values,
      fit measures, and modification indices
    o Model matrices section shows only modeled matrices (not derived/implied quantities)
    o Matrix output uses 2-digit rounding with dots for fixed zeros
  o Fixed prune() error when no parameters to test in the requested matrix:
    o adjust_p_values() now correctly returns a numeric vector (not the S4 model object) when nTest == 0
  o Fixed backward compatibility for models saved without the WLS.Gamma slot:
    o Added .hasSlot() guard to prevent "no slot of name 'WLS.Gamma'" warnings

Changes in Version 0.14.12
  o Added WLSMV scaled test statistic (mean-and-variance adjusted chi-square) for WLS/DWLS/ULS estimators:
    o Implements the scaled-shifted test (Asparouhov & Muthen, 2010) matching lavaan's WLSMV output
    o New fit measures: chisq.scaled, df.scaled, pvalue.scaled, chisq.scaling.factor
    o Scaled incremental fit indices: cfi.scaled, tli.scaled, nfi.scaled, rfi.scaled, ifi.scaled, rni.scaled, nnfi.scaled
    o Scaled RMSEA: rmsea.scaled
    o Baseline model also receives scaled test statistic (baseline.chisq.scaled, etc.)
    o Added WLS.Gamma slot to store the full asymptotic covariance matrix (Gamma) per group
    o Added LS_Gamma() helper function for computing Gamma from raw data
    o Scaling factors match lavaan to 6+ decimal places for both ordinal and continuous data
    o Supports single-group and multi-group models
  o Changed the default estimator for ordinal data from WLS to DWLS, matching lavaan's convention
  o Added "WLSMV" as an estimator alias for "DWLS" in lvm() and varcov()
  o Fixed the DWLS weight matrix for ordinal data:
    o Previously used diag(Gamma^{-1}) (diagonal of the full inverse), which differs from standard
    o Now uses 1/diag(Gamma) (reciprocal of the diagonal), matching the lavaan convention
  o Fixed (n+1)/n scaling bug in ULS fit function, gradient, and expected Hessian (R and C++):
    o The weight matrix normalisation factor was (n+1)/n instead of 1, causing small systematic bias

Changes in Version 0.14.11
  o Added corinput support to the lvm framework:
    o lvm() now accepts a 'corinput' argument to specify that the input is a correlation matrix
    o When corinput=TRUE, residual variances (diagonal of sigma_epsilon) are derived from the constraint diag(sigma) = 1
    o Diagonal sigma_epsilon parameters are fixed and derived in the implied function, not freely estimated
    o Supports WLS, DWLS, and ULS estimators; defaults to WLS when corinput=TRUE
    o Variance identification is automatically enforced
    o Both R and C++ code paths updated (implied and derivatives)
  o Fixed a bug in the identity weight matrix dimension in samplestats for corinput/meanstructure combinations

    o Builds a local quadratic model and solves the Newton system via preconditioned conjugate-gradient
    o Supports box constraints and analytic gradients
    o Added nloptr to Imports
  o Fixed CRAN NOTE: commented out stray std::cout in vendored LBFGS++ header (LineSearchMoreThuente.h)

Changes in Version 0.14.9
  o Tuned LBFGS++ convergence parameters for better performance on ill-conditioned models:
    o Switched primary convergence criterion from gradient norm to relative function change (delta = 1e-8), matching nlminb behavior
    o Increased L-BFGS history size from 6 to 10 for better Hessian approximation on larger models
    o Relaxed gradient tolerance (epsilon = 1e-5) to avoid unnecessary iterations on ill-conditioned FIML problems
    o ~4x faster on complex dlvm1/panel models (e.g., 8.6s -> 2.0s on 84-parameter panelgvar)
  o Removed unused variable declarations to eliminate all compiler warnings from psychonetrics C++ source

Changes in Version 0.14.8
  o Added LBFGS++ (LBFGSpp) as a new pure C++ optimizer, available via setoptimizer(x, "LBFGS++"):
    o Vendored header-only LBFGS++ library (MIT license) into inst/include/
    o Combined function+gradient evaluation exploits the prepareModel cache for efficiency

    o Fixed expectedmodel() to replace sample sufficient statistics with model-implied expectations for Ising models

Changes in Version 0.14.5
  o Optimized dlvm1 Jacobian construction (d_phi_theta_dlvm1_group_cpp):
    o Added dense Kronecker helpers (kronecker_I_X_dense, kronecker_X_I_dense) to avoid slow sparse element-by-element insertion when the result is used as a dense matrix
    o Precompute the constant "between" Kronecker block once instead of recomputing it for every lag

  o Fixed dplyr 1.1.0 deprecation warning about one-column matrices in filter() calls

Changes in Version 0.14.3
  o Cache-aware prepareModel_cpp: skip redundant prepare when fit and gradient are called at the same parameter vector
  o ~24% speedup in full model fitting (e.g., 9-variable CFA: ~155ms -> ~118ms)

Changes in Version 0.14.2
  o Expanded OptimWorkspace to cache all constant S4 model/sample data (extramatrices, types, sample stats, etc.)
  o All prepare_*_cpp and implied_*_cpp_core functions now read from cached workspace instead of S4 slots
  o prepareModel_cpp post-processing now reads from workspace instead of S4 slots

Changes in Version 0.14.1
  o Performance optimization: replaced O(nMat * nPar) parameter-to-matrix mapping with O(nFreePar) direct index mapping
  o Eliminated S4 model cloning during optimization iterations by bypassing updateModel_cpp in all prepare functions
  o Refactored all 8 implied_*_cpp functions into _core variants that accept pre-formed matrices

Changes in Version 0.13
  o Added bootstrap support:
    o Every model now supports 'bootstrap' (to enable bootstrap), 'boot_sub' (for subsampling) and 'boot_resample' (to resample)
    o Enabling these will bootstrap the data *once* and create a psychonetrics object for the bootstrap sample
    o The function 'aggregate_bootstraps' can be used to aggregate bootstraps:
      o use print(...) for some general info
      o use parameters(...) for the bootstrap results on the parameters
      o use fit(...) for the bootstrap results on the fit indices
      o use CIplot(...) for the bootstrap results on the confidence intervals (enable split0=TRUE if model selection is used)

Changes in Version 0.12
  o Updates for the dlvm1 model family:
    o Changed the starting values for dlvm1 models for better convergence
    o Added the 'start' argument to the dlvm1 model family. Use start = "version1" to use pre 0.12 start values
    o Added the 'baseline' argument to dlvm1 model family, which now defaults to "stationary_random_intercept". Note: this will change incremental fit indices! To recover old behavior, set baseline = "independence"
  o The log(det(kappa)) value used in fit function is now computed in FIML in the same way as computed in ML framework, this should lead to more stability, but might also lead to some different chi-square values
  o The startreduce argument in prune() now defaults to 1
  o Using "empty" for matrix specification is now deprecated; use "diag" or "zero" instead.

  o Fixed some instances where the 'equal' argument wasn't working
  o 'partialprune' now supports multiple matrices
  o 'unionmodel' and 'intersectionmodel' now support the 'matrices' argument
  o Changed lambda starting value choice to the following: Run an EFA, set the starting values to the loadigs of the factor that has the strongest loadings in the indicators, and set correlations between factors that use the same EFA factor for starting values to 0.8
  o added warning for non computed model in parameters()

Changes in Version 0.11.5

  o Fixed a bug in the identification function for ml_lvm models
  o Implemented min_sum argument for estimating Ising models on data with a minimum sum score due to selection bias. This method is further discussed in  Boot, de Ron, Haslbeck & Epskamp (in preperation). Correcting for selection bias after sum score selection in the Ising model.
  o The 'warn_improper' argument in runmodel now defaults to FALSE, omitting the warning that a non-positive defnite matrix was encountered in parameter estimation.

Changes in Version 0.10.2
  o Added 'threshold' argument to getmatrix()
  o Adjusting p-values is now done by default only for the tested p-values. This means that the number of tests is assumed to be the number of parameters of interest (matrices that are to be pruned), not the total number of parameters. Previous behavior can be reproduced with mode = "all" in prune(..).
  o panelvar and panelgvar now support arguments within_latent and between_latent

Changes in Version 0.10.1
  o Fixed a bug in 'prune' which did not allow intercept/mean vectors to be pruned

    o Added meta-analysis model for varcov family (meta_varcov)
    o The ml_tsdlvm1 function now allows for multi-kevek tsdlvm1 models (dlvm1 models) to be specified using syntax familiar to those using mlVAR and graphicalVAR
  o Minor changes
    o Numerous small bugfixes and improvements (e.g., better starting values)
    o Added function 'fullFIML' to use true FIML computing the likelihood per row
    o Changed 'WLS.V' to 'WLS.W'

  o The scale of the Fisher information matrix has been adjusted to portray unit information to be similar to Lavaan
  o The getVCOV function has been added to obtain the estimated asymptotic var-cov matrix of the parameters.
  o The meanstructure can now be ignored using meanstructure = TRUE in the following model families:
    - varcov
  o A correlation matrix can now be used as input (detected or set with corinput = TRUE) for the following families:
    - varcov (type = "ggm" and type = "cor")
  o The WLS estimator will now not investigate means when meanstructure is ignored, and variances when a correlaton matrix is used as input.
    - The WLS weights matrix must be of the appropriate dimensions!
    - The WLS.V matrix will no longer be adjusted for missing means.
    - Added 'startEPC' argument to stepup and freepar
  o Added the 'modelsearch' function for extensive stepwise model search
