# Numeric code are internal functions:
# 00: This file
# 01: classes definitions
# 03: Functions to aide in model formation. E.g., generate sample table, parameter table, model matrices..
# 04: General Gaussian fit, gradient and Hessian
# 05: General Binary fit, gradient and Hessian
# 06: Model specific fit functions
# 99: Old codes to be removed

# Letter codes are exported functions and executables both used internally and externally (e.g., addfit())
# a: model generation codes
# b: functions that expand models, e.g., add MIs
# c: model execution
# d: Stepup search
