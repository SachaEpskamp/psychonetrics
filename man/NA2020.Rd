\title{
Network Analysis 2020 Self-Report Data
}
\description{
A subset of self-report data collected in 2020 by Adela-Maria Isvoranu as part of a graduate-level course on network analysis at the University of Amsterdam. Students in the course collected the data from a convenience sample. The full dataset contains responses to 87 items covering topics such as sleep, well-being, and social functioning. This subset contains 8 items used in Chapter 6 of the textbook \emph{Network Psychometrics with R} (Epskamp, Isvoranu, & Haslbeck, in preparation) to demonstrate Gaussian Graphical Model estimation with psychonetrics. All items are rated on a 1--7 Likert scale. The dataset contains some missing values, making it suitable for demonstrating FIML estimation.
